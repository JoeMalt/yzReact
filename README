yzReact - A PHP / MySQL / JavaScript reaction timing system.

This program exists to answer a question: when people are viewing words which imply a metaphorical position, such as "King" or "Servant", are they quicker and/or more accurate in identifying them when they are placed in the corresponding area of the screen?

It is currently VERY UNFINISHED. It is vulnerable to SQL injection, the interface is practically non-existent and there is no admin panel yet. I recommend you do not use it yet.
