yzReact CODE STRUCTURE

=====test.php=====
Takes SESSION param(s): user ID, sem_field_pair_id
Sends data to test_process.php
    Parameters: session_id, time, was_correct, sem_field_pair_id


=====pretest.php=====
Reads SESSION data and says how many tests taken/wanted
Click link to test.php

=====test_process.php=====
Inserts parameters from test.php into the database
Increments a SESSION variable: tests_taken
If SESSION['tests_taken'] < SESSION['tests_desired'], redirects via 301 back to test.php else goes to pretest.php


=====session_initialise.php===== DONE
Takes POST parameter: session_id
Retrieves details of intended session from DB (sem_field_pair_id, tests_desired) and loads them into SESSION
Initiates test.php for the first time


=====session_conclude.php=====
Destroys session, displays a "thank you" message



yzReact ADMIN CONTROL PANEL

=====adm/add_sem_field_pair.php=====
Takes a name and two data sets (text files with words separated by \n), as well as position information (T or B)
Position info may be extended in the future to include things like text formatting


=====adm/view_overall_data.php=====
Displays the aggregated data from the database




yzReact SESSION VARIABLES

*int tests_taken
*int tests_desired
*int session_id (May or may not be used, useful to have)
*int sem_field_pair_id




yzReact DATABASE DESIGN

=====Table RESULTS=====
int auto_increment result_id (Primary key)
int sem_field_pair_id
int time (Time taken in milliseconds)
bool orientation (TRUE if "right" way round, "false" otherwise)
bool correct

=====Table SEM_FIELD_PAIRS=====
int sem_field_pair_id (primary key, useful)
string sem_field_a_file (Location of text file containing words separated by \n)
char sem_field_a_orientation (Currently H or L)
string sem_field_b_file (Location of text file containing words separated by \n)
char sem_field_b_orientation (Currently H or L)

=====Table SESSIONS=====
int session_id
int tests_desired
int sem_field_pair_id
bool begun
bool complete


yzReact FILE FORMAT
Word lists should be in plain ASCII, with *nix newlines (CRLF probably won't work)


yzReact TODO
- Make was_correct feed to the DB properly
- Escape database stuff, preferably get MySQLi to work
- Obfuscate / POST test responses
- Add detail to session_initialise.php
